# Building a SQL database of MLB statistics

In this project I did through the Dataquest platform, I:

- Import CSV data into a database.
- Design a normalized schema for a large, predominantly single table data set.
- Create tables that match the schema design.
- Migrate data from unnormalized tables into our normalized tables.
